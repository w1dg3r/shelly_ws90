The WS90 Weather app brings professional-grade weather monitoring to your Homey. Connect your Ecowitt WS90 weather station via MQTT and access real-time data including temperature, humidity, wind speed, UV index, and precipitation directly in your Homey flows.

Perfect for automating your home based on actual weather conditions. Turn on sprinklers when rain is detected, close awnings when wind picks up, or adjust heating based on outdoor temperature and humidity.
